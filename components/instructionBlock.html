            <h3>Checking the Cable with a Multimeter</h3>
            <p>
              Take the multimeter and set the dial from 0 to 25K (see Figure 1).
            </p>
            <p>
              Touch one probe of the multimeter to one end of the cable and the
              other probe to the opposite end (see Figure 2).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the multimeter display shows a value other than zero, your
              cable is functioning correctly.

        <h2>3. HOW TO UNDERSTAND IF THE SHEET IS GROUNDED</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Run the tester over the surface of the fabric. If the tester lights
            up, the fabric is conductive. The round connector on one end of the
            cable should be connected to the special attachment located on the
            sheet. The other end with the plug should be inserted into the
            socket in the grounded outlet. Now your sheet is grounded.

              Since the ECOHEAL sheet is made from exclusively natural
              components — organic cotton and silver, it will shrink by 3 to 5%
              after the first wash. Our team has taken this into account when
              designing the sizes. Before the first wash, the sheet will be
              slightly larger than the standard size, but after washing, it will
              acquire the correct dimensions. For reference, we provide a size
              chart.

        <h2>5. I DON’T FEEL ANY EFFECT</h2>
        <p>
          Grounding, which involves contact between your body and the Earth's
          surface, may produce noticeable effects at different speeds depending
          on the individual. Some people report positive effects, such as
          reduced pain or stress relief, after just one session. These quick
          results are often associated with the ability of grounding to balance
          the body's electrical energy.
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              For more significant and long-term effects, such as reducing
              inflammation, improving circulation, and decreasing muscle pain,
              more regular use may be necessary — perhaps several weeks. The
              body needs time to adjust and respond to deeper changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people start noticing consistent improvements within the
              first few months of regular grounding. However, for the best
              results, it's recommended to make grounding a regular part of your
              life. As with any wellness practice, the more you do it, the more
              long-term benefits you will gain.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, grounding can provide quick relief for some people, but
              for long-term improvements, it’s important to practice it
              regularly.

              Why ECOHEAL fabric is the best choice for your health: Our fabric
              consists of a unique blend: 11% silver, 4% silk, and 85% organic
              cotton. Silver is applied in the form of small 8x8 mm squares,
              ensuring that your body comes into contact with a large amount of
              silver throughout the night. This allows the fabric to completely
              block electromagnetic fields (EMF), providing you with a more
              restful and protected sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              The added silk makes the sheet incredibly soft and comfortable, so
              you get the best of both worlds: protection and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              With ECOHEAL, you are investing in better sleep, better health,
              and a more comfortable night.

        <h2>7. REGULAR MASK</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          The ECOHEAL brand uses high-quality 100% silver fabric on the inside
          of the sleep mask, bringing unique benefits to your night’s rest.
          Here's how this special fabric can improve your sleep:
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              <span>Antibacterial protection:</span> Silver naturally fights
              bacteria, helping keep the mask clean and fresh longer. This means
              fewer unpleasant odors and less frequent washing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Soothing effect on the skin:</span> The silver fabric gently
              affects the skin and can even help reduce inflammation. This is
              ideal for people with sensitive skin or prone to irritation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Improved circulation:</span> Some studies suggest that
              silver can improve circulation, helping reduce puffiness and dark
              circles around the eyes in the morning.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Temperature regulation:</span> Silver has natural
              temperature-regulating properties, ensuring a comfortable and cool
              sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Hypoallergenic:</span> Silver fabric is hypoallergenic,
              making the mask a great choice for people with allergies or
              sensitive skin.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the ECOHEAL sleep mask, you not only get complete darkness
              for better sleep, but also additional benefits in terms of
              cleanliness, comfort, and skincare.

        <h2>8. HOW TO STORE</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure the durability and quality of the sheets, it is important to
          consider storage conditions. Our sheets may be negatively affected by
          moisture and salt and require special attention. If you live near the
          coast or travel frequently by sea or ocean, it is recommended to store
          the sheets in airtight bags to protect them from exposure to sea water
          and moisture.
